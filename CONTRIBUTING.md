# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Every little bit of help counts!

## Install

### Requirements:
- [Python 3][python]

Clone the repository and enter into the project's folder:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:scanapi/scanapi.git
$ cd scanapi
```

Create a [virtualenv][virtualenv] for ScanAPI and activate it:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -e .[dev] .[test]
$ pip install -e .
$ pre-commit install
```

If the last three commands have failed, please try directly these:

```shell
$ python setup.py develop
$ pip install click==7.0 curlify==2.2.1 jinja2==2.10.3 pyyaml==5.1.1 requests==2.22.0 black==19.10b0 ipdb==0.13.2 pre-commit==1.20.0 codecov==2.0.15 pytest==5.2.4 pytest-cov==2.8.1 pytest-mock==1.11.2 requests-mock==1.7.0
$ pre-commit install
```

## Run

Run the ScanAPI:

```shell
$ scanapi
```

For help, run:

```shell
$ scanapi --help
```

But as you may noticed, you need an API specification file to run ScanAPI properly.
Otherwise you will receive this error:

```shell
$ scanapi
ERROR:scanapi:Could not find API spec file: api.yaml. [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'api.yaml'
```

For that, we have the [ScanAPI Examples][scanapi-examples] repository, with some API specification
examples that could be used.

### Clone ScanAPI Examples

In another terminal tab, outside `scanapi` folder, clone the [ScanAPI examples][scanapi-examples]
 project:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:scanapi/scanapi-examples.git
```

Your workspace should have these both folders now:

```shell
‚ñ∂ ls
scanapi               scanapi-examples
```

Activate the virtualenv created before:

```shell
. scanapi/venv/bin/activate
```

Enter on `scanapi-examples` folder:

```shell
$ cd scanapi-examples
```

Select the example you want to run (`scanapi-demo` for instance):

```shell
$ cd scanapi-demo
```
Run the ScanAPI:

```shell
$ scanapi
```

## Tests

```shell
$ cd scanapi
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pytest
```

## Deploy

Steps:
1. Release PR
2. Deploy on GitHub

### 1. Release PR

### Bump the lib Version

Check the last release number at https://pypi.org/manage/project/scanapi/releases/
Increment the version number at `setup.py` according to the version you have just got.

### Update the CHANGELOG.md

Add a new version title with the new version number and the current date, like [this](https://github.com/camilamaia/scanapi/commit/86e89e6ab52bbf64e058c02dbfdbbb1500066bff#diff-4ac32a78649ca5bdd8e0ba38b7006a1eR9-R10)

And add the version links, like [this](https://github.com/camilamaia/scanapi/commit/86e89e6ab52bbf64e058c02dbfdbbb1500066bff#diff-4ac32a78649ca5bdd8e0ba38b7006a1eR69-R70)

### Create the PR

Create a PR named `Release <version>` containing these two changes above.

[Example of Release PR](https://github.com/camilamaia/scanapi/commit/86e89e6ab52bbf64e058c02dbfdbbb1500066bff)

### Merge the PR

Once the PR was accepted and passed on all checks, merge it.

### 2. Deploy on GitHub

Deploy on GitHub is done when a [new release is created][creating-releases].

- The `tag version` should be `v<version>`, like for example `v0.0.18`.
- The `release title` should be the same as tag version,(e.g `v0.0.18`).
- The `release description` should be the content copied from the CHANGELOG.md file from the
corresponding version section.

Real examples are available at: https://github.com/scanapi/scanapi/releases.

When the Deploy on GitHub is done, the new version will be automatically deployed on [Docker Hub][scanapi-on-docker-hub] and [PyPI][scanapi-on-pypi].
Check if everything run as expected for both and that is it, the deploy is done üéâ
